# Image classification model using FastAI

Previousy , I used CNN and other pretrained network to classify images. In this project, I explore FastAI and its usefullness
I will be deploying standard techniques taught in the fast.ai  to see how well these techniques can perform without needing expert knowledge. The techniques are:

* Learning rate finder
* 1-cycle learning
* Differential learning rates for model finetuning
* Data augmentation
* Test time augmentation
